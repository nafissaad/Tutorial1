       "'rgy prices, so-called core CPI still rose 6.2%, against expectations for a 6% gain, clouding hopes that inflation had peaked in March.\\n\\nThe month-over-month gains also were higher than expectations â€” 0.3% on headline CPI versus the 0.2% estimate and a 0.6% increase for core, against the outlook for a 0.4% gain.\\n\\nThe price gains also meant that workers continued to lose ground. Real wages adjusted for inflation decreased 0.1% on the month despite a nominal increase of 0.3% in average hourly earnings. Over the past year, real earnings have dropped 2.6% even though average hourly earnings are up 5.5%.\\n\\nInflation has been the single biggest threat to a recovery that began early in the Covid pandemic and saw the economy in 2021 stage its biggest single-year growth level since 1984. Rising prices at the pump and in grocery stores have been one problem, but inflation has spread beyond those two areas into housing, auto sales and a host of other areas.\\n\\nFederal Reserve officials have responded to the problem with two interest rate hikes so far this year and pledges of more until inflation comes down to the central bankâ€™s 2% goal. However, Wednesdayâ€™s data shows that the Fed has a big job ahead.\\n\\nCredits: cnbc.com'"
